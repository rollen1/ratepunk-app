# Ratepunk Front End Task

## Technologies:

- React.js
- Sass

## Instructions:

- Create single page landing for desktop and mobile 
- Show success/error message depending if email typed is correct and/or input is not empty
- Use JSONBIN (https://jsonbin.io/) to save only the last entered email 
- Menu links can be empty 
- Social links can be empty

## Progress:

- Finished design from scratch, but not yet responsive
- Added html input type=email so it's sort of an error if they mistype email
    - still need to code in success message
- Didn't use jsonbin yet
- Everything else done
